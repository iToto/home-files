# Weekly meeting

## Desired outcomes

* A prioritized list of issues, in the current project or milestone, so that the team has shared understanding of what to work on next.
* An understanding of what we're each working on next, so that we can proceed efficiently - whether in one or parallel paths.
* A list of any blockers, and an agreement on who can assist in unblocking and when.
* A list of any newly-identified action items, captured via [meeting notes][meeting-notes].
* An understanding of our progress toward the upcoming milestone (if applicable).
* An awareness of the project's *next* milestone (if applicable).
* A list of interactions with other teams (e.g., Identity, Security, etc.) that weâ€™ll face in the next two weeks.

## Stakeholders

* Engineering manager: @iToto
* Product manager: @hpsin

## Meeting roles

* Facilitator: first responder from the previous week

## Decision making

We prefer to make decisions through consensus. If the team cannot reach consensus, the EM will identify the appropriate person to make the decision at hand, and we will move forward with that person's decision.

## Preparation

* Merge the weekly deploy branch
* Go through 'In progress' column
  * Mark any issues as 'Done' with a cross reference to the PR that closed it
  * Ping responsible team member to see if they have an update or need anything to move forward
