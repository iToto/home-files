# Boilerplate Go API

This is a simple boilerplate application in Go for a HTTP API.
It comes with a logger, custom context and some helpers.

## How To

To use this boilerplate simply:
1. Clone the repo
2. Delete the `.git` folder to get a fresh start
3. Rename `my-app` with the name of your app
4. Make any required changes to the configs, Makefile and Docker files

## Contribute

This is intended to be used as a quick way to standup an API service in Go. Feel free to PR any suggestions or improvements that you think might be helpful for a future service ðŸ’ª
